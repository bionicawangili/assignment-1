<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The evaluation process would include how long users visit the website, what pages were visited in what order, how many times a page was used from most used pages and least used pages, etc. Counters, weblogs, and capture of demographic information with cookies provide constant monitoring.



</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The client wish the website can attract younger audience therefore, the target audience for this site is high school kids to young adults<br><br>

Younger people would be more attracted to colorful design so the website should be colorful and contain textured background to make it look attractive for the audience. <br> <br>

For the font choice I chose Helvetica which is San-Serif type of font is more suitable for sports because it is straight edged and heavier font.<br><br>
